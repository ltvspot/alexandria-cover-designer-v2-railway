    label: 'Film Noir',
    modifier: 'Depict as a high-contrast film noir composition. Dramatic black-and-white with a single deep amber or crimson accent. Hard-edged silhouettes, slashing shadows, extreme chiaroscuro.

    modifier: 'Render as a vintage natural history or botanical engraving. Exquisitely detailed scientific illustration with fine intaglio linework, meticulous stipple shading, and hairline cross-hatching.

    label: 'Expressionist',
    modifier: 'Render in the bold Expressionist style of Munch, Kirchner, and Emil Nolde. Vivid, distorted colours — acid yellow, blood orange, electric blue — applied in thick, agitated brushstrokes. Warped perspectives and exaggerated forms that convey raw emotional intensity. The scene should feel psychologically charged and unsettling.'
  },
  {
    id: 'baroque',
    label: 'Baroque Drama',
    modifier: 'Depict as a grand Baroque composition in the style of Rubens, Velázquez, and Caravaggio. Theatrical lighting with a single dramatic light source against deep darkness.

  },
  {
    id: 'watercolour',
    label: 'Delicate Watercolour',
    modifier: 'Paint as a refined watercolour illustration. Translucent washes of colour that let the white ground glow through. Soft, fluid edges with subtle gradations of tone.

  },
  {
    id: 'russian-realist',
    label: 'Russian Realist',
    modifier: 'Paint in the tradition of 19th-century Russian realism — Ilya Repin, Ivan Kramskoi, Vasily Vereshchagin. Dense atmospheric detail, muted earth tones of ochre, raw umber, and slate grey with flashes of colour. Thick expressive brushwork capturing raw human emotion, social drama, or the vastness of the Russian landscape. Unflinching and deeply humane.'
